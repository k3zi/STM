/**
	Convenience wrapper for the AudioFilePlayer unit.
    It exposes only certain functionality of the AudioFilePlayer unit.
    For simplicity's sake, only one file at a time can be scheduled for playback.
 
    Using YBScheduledSoundPlayer:
 
    1- Create a player using -[graph addNodeWithType:YBAudioComponentTypeAudioFilePlayer]
    2- Set its fileURL property to the file that you want to open
    3- Set a region that needs to be scheduled using one of the -setRegion... methods
    4- Prime the player's buffers using one of the -primeBuffers... methods
    5- Define the player's starting time using one of the -setStartTimeStamp... methods
 
    For step 3-5 you can also use the convenience method -scheduleEntireFilePrimeAndStartImmediately
